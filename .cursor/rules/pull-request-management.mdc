# Pull Request Management

## Creating Pull Requests

When asked to create a pull request, follow these steps:

1.  **Title**: The PR title MUST follow the Conventional Commit format (e.g., `feat: Add user profile page`, `fix: Correct login validation`). The type should reflect the overall nature of the changes in the branch.
2.  **Target Branch**: All PRs should target the `development` branch unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
3.  **Body/Description**: The PR body should be detailed and clear.
    *   Start with a high-level summary of the changes.
    *   Use bullet points to list the specific changes made.
    *   If it resolves an existing issue, link to it (e.g., "Closes #123").
    *   Do not simply list the commit messages. Provide a human-readable summary.

## Reviewing Pull Requests

When asked to review a pull request, perform the following checks:

1.  **Code Quality**:
    *   Does the code adhere to the project's linting rules and style guide?
    *   Is the code clear, readable, and maintainable?
2.  **Functionality**:
    *   Do the changes correctly implement the requested feature or fix the reported bug?
    *   Have you pulled down the branch and run the project locally (e.g., `npm run storybook`) to manually verify the changes?
    *   Have you run the build (`npm run build`) and tests (`npm test`) to ensure nothing is broken?
3.  **Testing**:
    *   Are there new tests for the new functionality?
    *   Do all existing and new tests pass?
4.  **PR Description**:
    *   Does the PR title and description accurately reflect the changes?

## Approving Pull Requests

- **Approve** the PR only if all the review checks pass without any issues. Add a brief, positive confirmation comment (e.g., "Looks great! All checks passed. Approving.").
- **Request Changes** if you find any issues. Leave specific, actionable comments on the lines of code where adjustments are needed. Summarize the required changes in a single review comment. Do not approve the PR.
