# Implementation Review and PR Suggestion

After you have finished implementing code changes for a feature, fix, or chore, follow this two-step process:

1.  **Request User Validation**:
    *   Do not assume the task is complete. You must ask the user to verify your work.
    *   Your message should be similar to this: "I have completed the implementation of [briefly describe the task]. Could you please review the changes to confirm everything is working as expected?"

2.  **Suggest Pull Request**:
    *   **Only after the user explicitly confirms** that the implementation is correct and successful (e.g., "Yes, it's working," "Looks good," "Approved"), you should then suggest the next step.
    *   Your follow-up message should be: "Great! Shall I now create a pull request with these changes?"
    *   Do not proceed to create the pull request until the user agrees.
