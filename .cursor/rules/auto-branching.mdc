# Automatic Branch Management

Before starting any code modifications, analyze the user's request to determine the nature of the task.

1.  **Identify Task Type**:
    *   Is it a new feature, an enhancement, or new functionality? -> **feature**
    *   Is it a bug fix, an error correction, or an issue resolution? -> **fix**
    *   Is it a refactor, a documentation update, a dependency upgrade, or other maintenance? -> **chore**

2.  **Create a New Branch**:
    *   If you are on the `main` or `development` branch, and the task requires code changes, you MUST create a new branch.
    *   Use the following naming convention: `[type]/[short-description-of-task]`
    *   Examples: `feature/add-user-authentication`, `fix/header-layout-issue`, `chore/upgrade-react-version`.

3.  **Proceed with Work**:
    *   Once the new branch is created and checked out, proceed with implementing the requested changes.
    *   Do not ask for permission to create the branch; perform this action proactively as part of the workflow.
