# Testing Strategy

A robust testing strategy is crucial for maintaining a high-quality component library. This document outlines the standards for both unit and end-to-end (E2E) tests.

## 1. Test Structure & Organization

### Centralized Test Directory
All tests are centralized in the `tests/` directory at the project root:

```
tests/
├── unit/
│   └── components/
│       ├── counter-card.test.tsx       # Custom components
│       └── ui/
│           └── card.test.tsx           # UI library components (if needed)
└── e2e/
    └── counter-card.spec.ts            # End-to-end tests
```

### File Naming Convention
- **Unit Tests**: `component-name.test.tsx`
- **E2E Tests**: `component-name.spec.ts`

### Test Exclusions
**DO NOT create tests for:**
- Components in `src/components/ui/` (shadcn/ui library components)
- These are third-party components with their own testing
- Focus testing efforts on custom business logic components

## 2. Unit Tests (Jest & React Testing Library)

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation. They should be fast, specific, and cover all essential component logic.

### What to Test:
- **Rendering:** Ensure the component renders correctly given a specific set of props. Test that conditional content appears or disappears based on props.
- **User Interaction:** Simulate user events (clicks, form input, keyboard events) and assert that the component's state or callback props behave as expected.
- **Accessibility:** Use helpers from `jest-axe` to check for basic accessibility violations.

### Best Practices:
- **File Location:** Tests must be in `tests/unit/components/` directory
- **Import Paths:** Adjust imports to reference the component location: `import { CounterCard } from '../../../src/components/counter-card'`
- **Element Selection:** Prefer user-facing attributes for selecting elements (`getByRole`, `getByLabelText`, `getByText`). Use `data-testid` only as a last resort when no other selector makes sense.
- **Mocking:** Mock all external dependencies, such as API calls, modules, or timers, to ensure tests are fast and deterministic.
- **Assertions:** Write clear and specific assertions. Instead of just checking if an element exists, check if it exists *and* has the correct content or attributes.

### Coverage Requirements:
- **100% coverage** required for all custom components
- **Exclude** `src/components/ui/**` from coverage (configured in jest.config.ts)
- **Focus** on business logic and custom component behavior

## 3. End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

E2E tests focus on verifying complete user flows from start to finish. They are slower and more complex than unit tests and should be reserved for critical application paths.

### What to Test:
- **Storybook Functionality:** Create tests that navigate the deployed Storybook instance, click through different stories, and interact with component controls to ensure everything renders correctly in a real browser environment.
- **Complex User Flows:** If a component is part of a complex, multi-step interaction (e.g., a multi-page form), an E2E test can validate the entire flow.
- **Visual Regressions:** Use Playwright's visual regression testing capabilities to take snapshots of components and fail tests if a visual change is detected unexpectedly.

### Best Practices:
- **File Location:** E2E tests must be in `tests/e2e/` directory
- **Storybook URLs:** Use direct iframe URLs for robust testing: `http://localhost:6006/iframe.html?id=components-countercard--default`
- **Test from the User's Perspective:** Write tests that mimic how a real user would interact with the application. Avoid relying on internal implementation details.
- **Page Object Model (POM):** For larger test suites, consider using the Page Object Model pattern to create reusable selectors and actions for different parts of your UI, making tests more readable and maintainable.
- **CI/CD Integration:** E2E tests should be run as part of your Continuous Integration pipeline against a preview or staging deployment, not during local development.

## 4. Test Commands

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run unit tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch
```

### E2E Tests
```bash
# Run E2E tests (all browsers)
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium
```

### All Tests
```bash
# Run both unit and E2E tests
npm test
```

## 5. General Principles

- **Clarity over Brevity:** Write tests that are easy to understand, even if it means they are slightly more verbose.
- **One Assertion per Test (When Possible):** While not a strict rule, aim to have tests that focus on a single behavior.
- **Coverage:** While 100% test coverage is not always a practical goal, all critical logic, complex UI interactions, and business rules MUST be covered by tests.
- **Test Organization:** Group related tests using `describe` blocks for better organization and readability.

## 6. Component Testing Checklist

When creating tests for a new component:

- [ ] **Unit Tests Created** in `tests/unit/components/`
- [ ] **100% Coverage** achieved for the component
- [ ] **All Props Tested** including edge cases and defaults
- [ ] **User Interactions** covered (clicks, inputs, etc.)
- [ ] **Conditional Rendering** scenarios tested
- [ ] **E2E Tests Added** in `tests/e2e/` (if component has complex interactions)
- [ ] **Accessibility** basic checks included
- [ ] **Error States** and edge cases covered
